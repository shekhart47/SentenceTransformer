You can enable unused parameter detection by passing the keyword argument `find_unused_parameters=True` to `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel`, and by 
making sure all `forward` function outputs participate in calculating loss. 
If you already have done the above, then the distributed data parallel module wasn't able to locate the output tensors in the return value of your module's `forward` function.
